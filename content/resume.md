## **404 Resume Not Found**
Oops! Looks like my resume is still buffering. Please check back after a few more coffee breaks!

---

## **Temporary Placeholder**
While you're waiting, here's a sneak peek of what to expect:

- **Experience:** Iâ€™ve experienced a lot... especially error messages and caffeine overdoses.
- **Skills:** Rapid Googling, Semicolon Hunting, and Exception Handling (in code and in life).
- **Education:** I've learned that the best teacher is a last-minute deadline.

---

## **Upcoming Features**
- **Error-Free Code (hopefully):** My code will eventually be bug-free by version 2.0 (fingers crossed).
- **Advanced Debugging Skills:** I'm currently leveling up by fighting the final boss - "Segmentation Fault".
- **Networking Prowess:** Not just social, but also the kind that involves routers and switches.

## **404 Joke of the Day**
Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
