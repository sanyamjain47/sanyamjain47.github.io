Basics of LaTeX, Bash, Docker, and Git. Data Structures \u0026 Algorithm Courses (COMP3821 – Score 83, Extended Algorithms) Relevant Experiences Software Engineer Intern, Canopus Networks (Apr 2023-Present) Played a key role in the development of major features for the main product using Go, concentrating on improving functionality and enhancing performance. Played a pivotal role in integrating new Go-written modules into the existing framework, ensuring seamless functionality and system stability. Conducted rigorous testing of Go code, including unit and integration tests, to ensure robustness and reliability of new features. Utilized Python for data scraping tasks, showcasing versatility in programming languages and the ability to automate and streamline data collection processes. Contributed to the development of insightful data analytics dashboards using Metabase and Superset, facilitating data visualization and decision-making processes. Software Engineer Intern, Arista Networks (Dec 2022 - Mar 2023) Contributed on a legacy codebase in C++ and added new features with emphasis on low-latency and memory management. Worked in Go to add support for new plugins in existing infrastructure. Added product tests in Python and C++ to test features on Arista hardware. Worked with InfluxDB to add support for publishing product related statistics to an external database. Added a customer facing command-line feature in product in Python. Collaborated and communicated with mentor and peers to report progress and discuss improvements and next steps in project. Software Engineer Intern, Canopus Networks (Feb 2022 - Nov 2022) Analysed network data and made relevant inferences including monthly plots using Python (Pandas and Plotly) and Wireshark. Worked on capturing gaming data and analysing gaming experience. Automated using Python to increase productivity of workflow. Worked in Go and React to develop full stack applications from scratch. Worked with Dr.Vijay Sivaraman on delivering narrative for findings. Research Project with Dr. Shuiqiao Yang (Dec 2021 - Apr 2022) Worked with Dr.Shuiqiao Yang on implementing an attacking strategy on a deep text mining model implemented in Pytorch based on Deep Embedding Clustering. Managed a team of 5 and handled conflict resolutions among peers by maintaining anonymity. Relevant Projects Discord Bot Designed a discord bot in Python that remind users about meetings. Deployed a MongoDB for storing data and reduced reads/writes from server by 50% in one month from initial testing. Python library for discord is no longer maintained by developer. Keylogger Done as course project for a Security Engineering course using Python for educational purpose. Logs all keystrokes in Ubuntu and sends to email and uploads to cloud. Takes screenshot whenever a new application is launched, and steals passwords stored in Firefox. Sudoku Solver Created an image-based sudoku solver using C++ and Python with OpenCV and TensorFlow. Notepad Developed a simple cross-platform notepad application using C++ and the Qt Framework. Extra Curricular Activities Peer Mentor Mentoring a group of 10 students and helping in transition from high school to university for 2 years. Established and maintained friendly relationships among all mentees. Coordinated with mentors, hosting a wide range of activities for mentees. Communicated with mentees about coursework, university life and problems faced. Project Subcommittee – Discord Bot Volunteered to help develop a discord bot in Python for CSESoc. Lead team of 6 people and helped coordinate and manage between team, directors, and other teams as well. Initially wrote in Python migrated to JavaScript due to discontinued support on python library and deployed using Docker. Designing bot to meet needs of 1900+ members. Promoted modelling bot on suggestions given by peers.
